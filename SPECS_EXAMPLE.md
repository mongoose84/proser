# Feature: User Authentication System

## Problem Statement
Users need secure access to the application with JWT-based authentication.

## Approach
Implement middleware-based authentication with token validation and refresh capabilities.

## Implementation Requirements
### Core Components
- [ ] JWT middleware (`src/middleware/auth.ts`)
- [ ] Token service (`src/services/token.ts`)
- [ ] User validation (`src/services/user.ts`)

### API Contracts
- `POST /auth/login` - Returns JWT token
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Refreshes expired token
- `GET /auth/verify` - Validates current token

### Validation Criteria
- [ ] Handles malformed tokens with 401 status
- [ ] Token expiration properly managed
- [ ] Refresh token rotation implemented
- [ ] Unit tests >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for all endpoints

## Handoff Checklist
- [ ] Architecture approved by team lead
- [ ] Database schema finalized
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Implementation ready for assignment
