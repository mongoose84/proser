## Technical Approach

### Backend Changes
**Language**: Go
**Components**:
- [ ] Data models: `[file path]`
- [ ] Business logic: `[file path]`
- [ ] API endpoints: `[file path]`
- [ ] Database migrations: `[file path]`

### Database Changes
**Database**: PostgreSQL

**Schema Changes**:
- [ ] New tables: [list tables]
- [ ] Modified tables: [list tables]
- [ ] New indexes: [list indexes]
- [ ] Data migrations needed: [describe]

### API Contracts
#### Endpoint 1
```
POST /api/[endpoint]
```
**Request**:
```json
{
  "field": "value"
}
```
**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {}
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
