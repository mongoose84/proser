# Code Refactoring Workflow

## Context Loading Phase
1. Review [target code](${targetFile})
2. Identify all [usages](semantic-search "function_name")
3. Check [test coverage](${testFiles})
4. Review [related documentation](../../docs/)

## Refactoring Planning
### Analysis
- [ ] Identify code smells and issues
- [ ] Map dependencies and impacts
- [ ] Verify test coverage exists
- [ ] List breaking changes

### Refactoring Strategy
- [ ] Define refactoring objectives
- [ ] Plan incremental steps
- [ ] Identify safe transformation patterns
- [ ] Plan for backward compatibility if needed

## Safe Refactoring Principles
1. **Small Steps**: Make small, incremental changes
2. **Test First**: Ensure tests pass before and after
3. **One Change**: One refactoring technique at a time
4. **Verify Often**: Run tests after each change

## Common Refactoring Patterns
### Simplification
- Extract method/function
- Inline method/function
- Consolidate duplicate code
- Simplify conditional expressions

### Organization
- Move method/function
- Rename for clarity
- Extract class/module
- Organize imports

## Execution Steps
1. Run existing tests to establish baseline
2. Apply refactoring incrementally
3. Run tests after each change
4. Update documentation
5. Final test run

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No functionality has changed
- [ ] Code is more readable
- [ ] Complexity has reduced
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] Documentation is updated

## Human Validation Gate
🚨 **STOP**: Review refactoring plan before execution.
Confirm: Test coverage is adequate, changes are incremental, rollback plan exists.
